# XAMPP Installation
XAMPP is a popular software package that provides a local development environment for web development. It includes the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and PHP, among other tools. Here are the steps to install and use XAMPP:

# Step 1: Download XAMPP:
Visit the official XAMPP website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Choose the appropriate version of XAMPP for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Click the "Download" button to download the installer file.

# Step 2: Install XAMPP:
Run the downloaded installer file to start the installation process.
Follow the instructions in the installer to choose the components you want to install. By default, it includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin.
Choose the installation directory for XAMPP (e.g., C:\xampp on Windows).
Complete the installation process by following the prompts.

# Step 3: Start the XAMPP Control Panel:
Once the installation is complete, open the XAMPP Control Panel. On Windows, you can find it in the installation directory (C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe).
On macOS, open the Launchpad and search for "XAMPP" to find and open the Control Panel.

# Step 4: Start the Apache and MySQL services:
In the XAMPP Control Panel, click the "Start" button next to Apache and MySQL. The status indicator should turn green, indicating that the services are running.
You can also configure XAMPP to start these services automatically when your computer starts by clicking the "Config" button and enabling the corresponding options.

# Step 5: Test the installation:
Open a web browser and enter http://localhost in the address bar.
If the XAMPP installation is successful, you should see the XAMPP welcome page.
To access phpMyAdmin and manage your databases, go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser.

# Step 6: Web development:
Place your web development files in the htdocs directory within the XAMPP installation directory (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows).
You can create subdirectories within htdocs to organize your projects.
Access your web application or website by entering http://localhost/your-project-folder in your browser, where your-project-folder is the name of the directory where your project files are located.


# PHPMailer Library Installation
PHPMailer is available on Packagist (using semantic versioning), and installation via Composer is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your composer.json file:

`"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.8.0"`
or run

`composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`

Note that the vendor folder and the vendor/autoload.php script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.

If you want to use the Gmail XOAUTH2 authentication class, you will also need to add a dependency on the league/oauth2-client package in your composer.json.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, you can download PHPMailer as a zip file, (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the include_path directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:
```
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;

use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```
If you're not using the SMTP class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a use line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the Exception class as it is used internally.
